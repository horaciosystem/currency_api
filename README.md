Currency Api
==============

> A JSON RESTFul Api that provides foreign exchange rates.

* **/currencies** Return actual currencies.

* **/currencies/:currency** Return the exchange rate for specified currency. i.e: /currencies/BRL

* **/convert? to = BRL & amount = 12** Return the conversion result of specified amount and currency. ```to``` and ```amount``` are query parameters.
